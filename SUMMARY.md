# ISO 20022 File Transformation Project Summary

## Overview
This project provides tools for analyzing ISO 20022 message structures and generating sample XML messages for different payment scenarios. It specifically focuses on the pacs.008 (Financial Institution To Financial Institution Customer Credit Transfer) message type.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Created Module Structure**
   - Implemented a modular Python package `iso_message_generator` with separate modules for message structure, rule processing, and XML generation
   - Created utility scripts for analyzing ISO files, extracting message structures, and generating custom messages

2. **Identified Payment Scenarios**
   - Analyzed the ISO 20022 pacs.008 Excel file to identify 7 distinct payment scenarios:
     - Domestic Payment
     - Cross-Border Payment
     - High-Value Payment
     - Urgent Payment
     - CAD Interbank Settlement
     - Return Payment
     - International Payment

3. **Generated Sample XML Messages**
   - Created sample XML messages for all 7 payment scenarios
   - Ensured all mandatory fields are included in each sample
   - Added appropriate amount fields and other required elements

4. **Added Rule Comments**
   - Added detailed comments to each XML file listing all 16 rules from the Excel file
   - Included rule IDs, names, and full definitions in the comments

5. **Enhanced with Optional Parameters**
   - Extracted 1523 optional fields from the Excel file
   - Added selected optional parameters to all sample XML files
   - Ensured proper structure for complex elements

6. **Validated Against XSD Schema**
   - Downloaded the official ISO 20022 XSD schema for pacs.008.001.08
   - Fixed BICFI pattern validation errors by using valid BIC codes
   - Fixed complex type structure issues in SvcLvl and LclInstrm elements
   - Successfully validated all 7 sample XML files against the XSD schema

7. **Created Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README.md with repository structure and usage instructions
   - XSD validation report documenting validation results
   - This summary report

## Repository Structure

- `iso_message_generator/`: Python module for ISO 20022 message generation
   - `message_structure.py`: Extract message structure from Excel files
   - `rule_processor.py`: Process validation rules and identify payment scenarios
   - `xml_generator.py`: Generate XML messages for payment scenarios

- `sample_messages/`: Sample XML messages for different payment scenarios
   - 7 sample XML files for different payment scenarios
   - All files include rule comments, optional parameters, and are XSD-validated

- `scripts/`: Utility scripts
   - Scripts for analyzing ISO files, extracting message structures
   - Scripts for generating and validating XML messages
   - Scripts for enhancing XML with optional parameters
   - Scripts for validating against XSD schema

- `data/`: Reference data files
   - `rtr_fi_to_fi_customer_credit_transfer_pacs.008excel.xlsx`: Reference Excel file

## Validation Results
All 7 sample XML files have been successfully validated against the ISO 20022 XSD schema. The validation report is available in `xsd_validation_report.md`.
